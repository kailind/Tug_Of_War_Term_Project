            We’ve had multiple exhibitions of guns causing pain and horror throughout history. As gun violence becomes more and more frequent, people are looking for ways to protect their safety.How does the authority treat issues around gun violence? Should we trust ourselves with rather than police? Let’s hear about the pro-gun team’s argument.

         So he would pound on me really bad, and I would take it year after year, and I would get pretty good at looking wounded so he would stop sooner. But anyway, one day I was with his cousin Kurt Schultz and Marky Welkirk and a couple of other guys at Kurt Schultz’s house in his bedroom, and we were smoking pot and listening to Pink Floyd. And the door kicked open, and it was Dennis, and he had his father’s Luger pistol.</p>

         <p class="textBody">And he turned and he said, Smokey, Smokey, and then he shot Kurt Schultz in the head. And Kurt flipped over the chair he was sitting in back like that, and we all totally freaked out, and I dove out the window. I just felt glass shattering around me, and I started running. And as I was running down the street, I heard Dennis Schultz scream, get your ass back here, faggot. And I was like oh God, I’ve got to get away from this guy. Anyway, I’m running, and he had come out of the room after me through the window. And I was running down the street, and I heard a shot, and I heard the bullet whistling past me, and I was running as fast as I could. And then I didn’t hear the shot that hit me. I just felt this sting in my back, and it kind of looked like this. The shot spun me around, and I landed, and he came running up to me, and he stood over me with the Luger. And he said, I don’t even know what he said actually, because I had by this time soiled my pants, and I was really shaking. And this was no act. I was really frightened.He had taken the bullets out of these bullets and dripped in wax over the gunpowder and put them back in this Luger. And he had done this act of terrorism, which I thought was really exceptionally creative.</p>

         <p class="textSpecial" id="shotFive"> And he just shot five times in my stomach, and I felt each time it hit me. I felt it striking me, and I looked down, and it was like wax! </p>

          <p class="textBody">Instantly conscripted my next door neighbor, Chris Williams, to steal his father’s .38 Police Special from his bedroom that night, and we spent like hours making these bullets. We’d take the lead out of the bullet, and we’d drip a little-- well, first we’d dump a little of the gunpowder out, and then we’d drip a little wax in there, and then we’d put a little ketchup or fake blood in there, and then we’d drip a little more wax on top. And we had it all figured out.</p>
          <p class="textBody">And so then we would go out into the countryside on these country roads in Wisconsin that had these really twisty, turny things. And we would scope it out. We’d watch the cars go by, and make sure that we had the sight lines all right, and then we would enact these great scenes where one of us would have the gun and the other would be running or standing there like, oh no. So the car would come around the corner and hit us with its light, and it would be like this boom, and ah, and fall. The car would screech to a halt, and then we’d get up and run away, and it was really a great time.</p>
          <p class="textBody">And we did one where we were standing in the road, and I was the one who got shot. And usually what happens is the car stops like 1,000 yards before he gets to you and then waits until nothing’s happening, and then slowly goes past. Well this car drove right up, and it was a police car. And these cops get out, and they have strong flashlights, so they can see us laughing in the bushes.</p>
          <p class="textBody">And they come over to us, and they weren’t too afraid, because by that time we were so afraid. They didn’t think that we were going to do anything with this gun, but they said, what are you kids doing?</p>
          <p class="textBody">And we told them what we were doing, and he said, oh yeah? Let me see. So I said, OK. So I had Chris set up, and we got all set, and these cops were standing there with their flashlights on us. And Chris shoots me, and I fall to the ground doing my thing.</p>

        <p class="textLast" id="summaryLast">Following Bryn Magnus’s story of playing with guns, we might feel a little scared behind the laughter. What if Bryn was holding a real gun but the policemen still thought it was a joke? As the country experiences frequent massive shootings, authority can become passive. Sometimes it seems like relying on guns is a good option for self-defense.</p>
