            In 1791, the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified. The amendment reads: “A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.” This is where the debate about gun control begins, and where the tug-of-war has started to form in this country. Since then, gun violence has become a hot topic. How do guns affect the state of violence? The anti-gun team has some arguments to say.

        <p class='nameBody'>Ira Glass </p>
        <p class="textBody">Drive-by shootings and tragic assaults where one teenager shoots another for a jacket or a pair of Nikes are such old news that we forget how we got to this point. Geoffrey Canada grew up in a tough neighborhood in the South Bronx(New York) before guns were commonplace in teenage culture there. He's also been a gun owner himself.  We wanted to talk to him about that, but first, a few words about the days before guns.</p>

        <p class='nameBody'>Geoffrey Canada </p>
        <p class="textBody">I’ll tell you, it was an absolute shock for me and my brothers when we moved from a relatively quiet area of the South Bronx, to what to us looked like a children’s paradise, with children playing in the streets and games. And we moved on the third floor on the front of the building.
        And I remember my brothers and I, we were waving at the little boys and girls from our window, waiting to go downstairs and make some friends. And one of the boys, they looked up, and he pointed his finger at me, took his fist, balled it into a fist, and rubbed it in his eye, and pointed back at me. And I remember looking at my brothers and saying, you know, I think that boy wants to beat us up. And we were stunned. We were like, for what? Why would they want to fight us?
        And we went to our mother, and we told her, Ma, I think the boys want to beat us up downstairs. And you know how mothers are. She was like, oh, don’t be foolish. You don’t even know those boys. Why would they want to beat you up? Just go down there and play. And we realized we were literally on our own with this. And it was from that initial introduction, each one of us had to go downstairs, have a fight, before we were accepted on the block.
        And when I look back on it, it was like you had to see where you fit in into a hierarchy in terms of being able to fight.  And once that was established, you were pretty much OK on the block.</p>

        <p class='nameBody'>Ira Glass </p>
        <p class="textBody">One of the things that you write about is that you say that the older boys on the block when you grew up would set the younger boys fighting.</p>

        <p class='nameBody'>Geoffrey Canada </p>
        <p class="textBody">That’s correct. And you know, it seemed awfully cruel to me before I knew sort of what I call the codes of violence that existed at that time. That we would just be sitting around, and the older boys would just really set us up to fight one another.</p>

        <p class="textBody">They would simply say that, "Rodney, can you beat Geoff?"</p>
        <p class="textBody">And Rodney would say, "I don't know."</p>
        <p class="textBody">And he'd say, "well, you scared of him?"</p>
        <p class="textBody">And he says, "I'm not scared of him."</p>
        <p class="textBody">They say, "Well, Geoff, are you scared of him?"</p>
        <p class="textBody">He's like, "I'm not."</p>
        <p class="textBody">And you were just trapped, and I would be sitting there thinking, why are they doing this? Why me and Rodney? We were just friends, and the next thing you know we’d be having a fistfight.</p>

      </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-12" id="mainbody_1_2">
       
          <div class="col-sm-5 animation_2" >


          <p class="textBody">Later I found out that the older boys really felt it was their responsibility to teach us how to fight, because if we didn’t learn it on Union Avenue, which was the block I grew up on in the South Bronx, then the other kids from Home Street, and Prospect Avenue, 157th Street, they would take advantage of us. But this was really largely fist fighting between kids that had rules around them.
          In my neighborhood there was no wrestling allowed in a fight, and the kids would break it up if you started to wrestle.They’d be like, no, no, that’s not fair. No. I have no idea. In another place, it was totally all right. But we really believed in these rules. And in the end the worst that would happen was maybe a kid would get a bloody nose, but no real long-lasting damage to you.</p>

          <p class="nameBody">Ira Glass </p>
          <p class="textBody">Explain what the other rules were. What were other parts of the code of conduct?
          Geoffrey Canada. When I was growing up, you had to fight somebody your own size.</p>
           
          <p class="nameBody">Ira Glass </p>
          <p class="textBody">Explain what the other rules were. What were other parts of the code of conduct?</p>

          <p class="nameBody">Geoffrey Canada </p>
          <p class="textBody">I mean, there was a real thing that people would say you couldn’t pick on somebody smaller than you. And people really reinforced this, and they would say, why are you bothering him? He’s not your size. You can pick on me. I’m your size. And people really believed that. You couldn’t fight girls, and these were pretty well-understood by the other members of our youth community.   Ira Glass One of the things about this whole system is that you could have a fight, and you could lose, and you could still maintain face.</p>

          <p class="nameBody">Geoffrey Canada </p>
          <p class="textBody">Oh, absolutely. There was no real shame in losing a fight if you fought well and courageously, and someone was just more skilled than you. Indeed, once that was established, you could accept the fact that someone could beat you.  And people would just ask, can you beat Tommy? And I would be like, no. And it was no big deal. They would just say, OK, Tommy’s more skilled. But it didn’t mean that under certain conditions I wouldn’t fight Tommy.</p>

          <p class="nameBody">Ira Glass </p>
          <p class="textBody">And so there were checks on violence.</p>

          <p class="nameBody">Geoffrey Canada </p>
          <p class="textBody">They really were. And typically there were not what I would consider to be a lot of random fights. Every now and then there’d be some fight between two guys who were trying to work something out, but basically everybody learned where they were in the pecking order, and we established some levels of comfort withone another.</p>

          <p class="nameBody">Ira Glass </p>
          <p class="textBody">Now with more guns on the street, what has happened to that system of checks?</p>

          <p class="nameBody">Geoffrey Canada</p>
          <p class="textBody">One of the things that happens when you have a handgun is that you don’t have to think about the consequences of your behavior that leads you into.a confrontation. And what I mean by that is that we actually had to think when we said something back. If we were walking down the block and somebody said something to us, and they were bigger than us, we had to think, jeez, if say something to this guy, am I really prepared to go fight him? And often the case was no, I don’t think so. So I’m going to pretend I didn’t hear it. With the handgun, you can really say, I don’t care how big somebody is. No one’s going to say that to me. And when someone does, you stop, and you say, who are you talking to? And you’re prepared to take it to the next level.</p>

          <p class="nameBody">Ira Glass</p>
          <p class="textBody">In your book Fist Stick Knife Gun there comes a point where you talk about when you got a handgun yourself. </p>

          <p class="nameBody">Geoffrey Canada</p>
          <p class="textBody">In 1971, well before the explosion of handguns on the streets of New York City, I bought a handgun. I bought the gun legally in Maine where I was in college. The clerk only wanted to see some proof of residency, and my Bowdoin College ID card was sufficient. The gun was exactly what I needed. It was so small I could slip into my coat pocket or pants pocket. I needed the gun because we had moved from Union Avenue to 183rd Street in the Bronx, but I still traveled  back to Union Avenue during the holidays when I was home from school. The trip involved walking through some increasingly dangerous territory. New York City was going through one of its gang phases, and several new ones had sprung up in the Bronx. One of the gangs liked to hang out right down the block from where we now lived on 183rd Street and Park Avenue. When I first went away to school, I paid no mind to the large group of kids that I used to pass on my way to the store or to the bus stop back to the Bronx. The kids were young, 14 or 15 years old. At 19 I was hardly worried about a bunch of street kids who thought they were tough, but over the course of the next year the kids got bolder and more vicious. On several occasions I watched with alarm as swarms of teenagers pummeled adults who had crossed them in one way or another. Everyone knew they were a force to be reckoned with, and many a man and woman crossed the street or walked around the block to keep from having to walk past them.
          And I crossed the street also, and there were times that I went out of my way to go to another store rather than walk past a rowdy group of boys who seemed to own the block. 
          On more than one occasion I rounded the corner only to come face to face with the gang. I could feel their eyes on me as I looked straight ahead, hoping none of them would pick a fight.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-5 animation_4">
      <p class="textBody">After having survived growing up in the Bronx, here I was scared to go home and walk down my own block. The solution was simple. I had a gun. I had a gun and an attitude. When I look back on the power the gun had over my personality and my judgment, I am amazed. It didn’t happen all at once. The change was subtle. At first I continue to avoid the gang of teenagers. I crossed the street or turned down another block when I saw them.
      But slowly, as I carried the gun with me day after day, my attitude began to change. I begin to think, why should I have to walk an extra block? Why should I feel that I have to cross the street or look down when I pass those kids? By the end of two weeks, I had convinced myself that all of the habits I had cultivated to avoid conflict with the gang wereunnecessarily conciliatory.
      My behavior when I went outside began to change. I stopped going out of my way, or crossing the street, or avoiding eye contact when I passed the gang. In fact, I began to do the opposite. I would choose to go to the grocery store on the side of the street where the gang was gathered. I would walk through them head up, eyes challenging, hand in my coat pocket, finger on the trigger. I was prepared to shoot to kill to defend myself. 
      My rationale was that I was minding my own business, not bothering anyone, but I wasn’t going to take any stuff from anyone. If they decided to jump me, well they would get what they deserved.
      I was lucky that winter break. The time quickly came for me to go back to college and no member of the gang had felt the need to challenge a strange young man with fire in his eyes and his hand always in his coat pocket. I knew if I continued to carry the gun in the Bronx, it would simply be a matter of time before I was forced to use it. My behavior would become more and more reckless each day. I unloaded the gun, wrapped it in a newspaper, took it to the town dump, and threw it away. </p>

      <p class="nameBody">Ira Glass </p>
      <p class="textBody">Geoffrey Canada says that the kind of fistfights that he grew up with ended in the Bronx in the 1970s. At one point in his book, he’s told that one reason for the increase of handguns in the hands of teenagers is because the gun manufacturers, after saturating the market of white males, started to market guns to women and to young people.</p>

      <p class="nameBody">Geoffrey Canada </p>
      <p class="textBody">It was absolutely-- for me it was a devastating discovery, because I was just really mortified to find out that what I considered to be my young people accidentally figuring out how to find these handguns through some hard looking and digging around in the inner cities was actually a marketing campaign that was aimed directly at them. And they started to change the names of handguns to make them more attractive to kids.</p>

      <p class="nameBody">Ira Glass </p>
      <p class="textBody">Names like Viper, you say in the book.</p>

      <p class="nameBody">Geoffrey Canada</p>
       <p class="textBody">Yes, and they weren’t finding these handguns. The handgun manufacturers were finding my kids. And it was not a small campaign. It was funded by millions of dollars.</p>

      <p class="nameBody">Ira Glass </p>
      <p class="textBody">Can you imagine what you would have thought as a kid if when you were 7 you would know that someday decades later you would be sitting in a studio? You would be writing a book about how much better it was back then?</p>

      <p class="nameBody">Geoffrey Canada </p>
      <p class="textBody">Yes. No, absolutely I could not have imagined doing that. And it’s one of the things that really shocked me so much, was that I remember these times as being so tough. But yet  I have to agree that this is tougher. It is tougher when you’re dealing with the fact of you could die than when you’re dealing with the fact that you could get beat up. Both  are horrible for children, and I don’t want to pretend that it’s not damaging to a child emotionally to grow up fearing for their physical safety. It’s more damaging to grow up fearing that you are going to be killed.</p>
