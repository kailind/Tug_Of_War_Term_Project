            We have heard different messages about the pros and cons from two teams. The anti-gun team attributes gun violence to the existence of gun possession, while the pro-gun team argue that gun serves as a powerful tool for self-protection. How did people arrive to their conclusions? Now, both teams are going to share their unqiue stories behind their perspectives and make their final arguments.

         Mike Robbins and Suzanna Hupp , who are both victims suffered from gun shooting, shared their stories behind their beliefs and perspectives about gun control. What it’s like getting shot at. We hear from two people who drew completely opposite conclusions from the experience.</p>
         <p class='nameBody'>Ira Glass</p>
        <p class="textBody">
         Now the story of two people nearly killed in gun attacks, two people who drew very different conclusions from their experiences. The first one we’re going to hear from is Mike Robbins, a Chicago police officer, who in 1994 was shot 11 times. One bullet that ripped through his abdomen is still lodged an inch from his spine. Robbins was working in the Gang Crimes Unit for the Chicago police. He and his partner answered a call about a gang disturbance. Shots had been heard. They drove down a dark alley. Robbins was driving, and somebody ran up to his side of the car. </p>
        
         <p class='nameBody'>Mike Robbins</p>
        <p class="textBody">
         It happened so fast, my partner and I didn’t get a chance to respond. My partner had his gun out. I had my gun out. And this individual just stuck the gun in the window and immediately began shooting, and stuck the gun into my chest repeatedly, several times point blank just stuck it into my chest and fired.</p>
         <p class='nameBody'>Ira Glass</p>
        <p class="textBody">
         And he’s shooting you in the chest. Were you wearing a bulletproof vest?</p>

         <p class='nameBody'>Mike Robbins</p>
        <p class="textBody">
         Yes, I was wearing a bulletproof vest. And in effect it’s like basically someone taking a cannon and putting it in your chest and firing. That’s exactly how hard it is. It’s like a horse maybe or an elephant kicking you in the chest very hard, very painful.</p>
         <p class='nameBody'>Suzanna Hupp</p>
        <p class="textBody">
         Basically in ‘91 my parents and I had gone to eat at a local restaurant on a bright, sunny day like today. We certainly weren’t in a dark alley somewhere where we weren’t supposed to be.</p>
         <p class='nameBody'>Ira Glass</p>
        <p class="textBody">
         This is Suzanna Gratia Hupp, a chiropractor in Texas and a gun owner.</p>
         <p class='nameBody'>Suzanna Hupp</p>
        <p class="textBody">
         And a crowded restaurant-- it was payday, and it was the day after Boss’ Day, a place that we went all the time. In fact, the manager that day had invited me. We were done eating, and all of a sudden this guy crashes his truck through the window, and we promptly heard gunshots. And when we heard that, your first thought is robbery. It’s a crowded place. It’s a robbery.So we immediately drop down. My father and I put the table up in front of us. But about 45 seconds into it, I’m going to say probably six people were killed at that point. He was not spraying bullets. He was simply walking from one person to the other, aiming, and pulling the trigger</p>

        <p class="textBody">
         In my case, the individual, I could never forget his face because his face was closer than yours and mine.</p>
         <p class='nameBody'>Ira Glass</p>
        <p class="textBody">
         And was he cold and clinical about it, or was he just angry?</p>
        
         <p class='nameBody'>Mike Robbins</p>
        <p class="textBody">
         Very much so</p>
         <p class='nameBody'>Ira Glass</p>
        <p class="textBody">
         He was clinical?</p>

         <p class='nameBody'>Mike Robbins</p>
        <p class="textBody">
         Very cold, very clinical, and just shooting, shooting repeatedly. My partner was shot six times. We screamed and hollered in the car at each other. There was just a lot of screaming and hollering. Some of the things were inaudible. We’re going to die. We’re going to die. Help me. Tell my mother I love her. I love you. I told him that I love you, and he told me he loved me.</p>
         <p class='nameBody'>Suzanna Hupp</p>
        <p class="textBody">
         Actually you would have expected it to be pandemonium, but no, it was very quiet, in fact. And you can ask anybody about that particular day. It was oddly quiet. You’d hear an occasional scream or an occasional moan or an occasional instruction shouted, like get down or something like that.</p>
         <p class='nameBody'>Ira Glass</p>
        <p class="textBody">
         But otherwise it was just completely silent?</p>
         <p class='nameBody'>Suzanna Hupp</p>
        <p class="textBody">
         Yes</p>
         <p class='nameBody'>Mike Robbins</p>
        <p class="textBody">
         I felt it took forever. The shooting was like in slow motion. When I look back at it in retrospect, I see things very slowly now.</p>
         <p class='nameBody'>Suzanna Hupp</p>
        <p class="textBody">
         At this point he was about 15 feet from us. He was about 3/4 of his back turned toward me. I had a place to rest my arm. It was a perfect opportunity.</p>
         <p class='nameBody'>Ira Glass</p>
        <p class="textBody">
         Perfect shot.</p>

        <p class="textSpecial obeyLaw">And then I realized that a few months earlier I made the stupidest decision of my life. My gun was 100 yards away in my car, completely useless to me, because I had chosen to obey Texas laws.</p>

          <p class="nameBody">Suzanna Hupp</p>
          <p class="textBody">Well at that point my father began to raise up and say, I got to do something. I got to do something. He’s going to kill everybody in here. And my attention turned to him, and I started grabbing him by the shirt and pulling him down.</p>
           
          <p class="nameBody">Mike Robbins</p>
          <p class="textBody">All the strength had been blown out of me, literally. I could no longer struggle or fight with this individual.? </p>

          <p class="nameBody">Suzanna Hupp</p>
          <p class="textBody">But when he saw what he thought was an opportunity, he jumped up and ran at the guy. Well, the guy saw my dad coming. He turned, pulled the trigger, shot my father in the chest.</p>

          <p class="nameBody">Mike Robbins</p>
          <p class="textBody">And I felt that this is the way I was going to die, and this is how it feels to die. These things were running through my mind as he was shooting.</p>

          <p class="nameBody">Suzanna Hupp</p>
          <p class="textBody">I stood up and I grabbed my mother by the shirt collar, and I said, come on, come on, we’ve got to run. We’ve gotto get out of here. And my feet grew wings, and I was one of the only people out of the front area there to make it out of the back.</p>
          <p class="nameBody">Ira Glass</p>
          <p class="textBody">How many people were killed that day?</p>
          <p class="nameBody">Suzanna Hupp</p>
          <p class="textBody">About 23 people. And I turned around to say something to my mother, and realized that she had not followed me out.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-1"></div>
      <div class="col-sm-5 animation_2">
          <p class="nameBody">Mike Robbins</p>
          <p class="textBody">One of the interesting things that happened was that I saw a vision of my mother at the time when we were shot. And my mother had passed in 1982. And if we have time I could tell you, but it doesn’t take too long. But at the time when this individual was shooting and shooting and shooting in our car, I somehow mustered enough strength to turn my body to the left. And when I did so, my mother just was in the back of the car, and she just grabbed me and pulled me right to her bosom, and just pulled my head right into her chest. She had no clothes on at all. She just pulled me right to her bare breasts, and just pulled me close.And at that time there was another loud bang and a big kick in my back. And he had shot me in the left side of my back in the shoulder blade, I found out later on. And then my mother had released me, and at that time the individual who was doing the shooting, he took off running down the alley.</p>
          <p class="nameBody">Suzanna Hupp</p>
          <p class="textBody">And I later learned from the cops my mother had crawled over to where my father was, and was cradling him until the gunman got back around to her. And they said he put the gun to her head, she looked up at him and put her head down, and he pulled the trigger.</p>
          <p class="nameBody">Mike Robbins</p>
          <p class="textBody">Well, just prior to the trial as we were being prepped by the state attorney’s office, they were asking what happened next, and what happened next, and what happened next. And I explained to them, and I explained to them just like I mentioned to you about my mother appearing and pulling me close to her. And they advised me not to do so.</p>
          <p class="nameBody">Ira Glass</p>
          <p class="textBody">Not to mention that on the stand.</p>

      <p class="textBody">Let me ask you a question. One of the people who we are interviewing for our show is a woman who is now a state representative in Texas. And she had an incident where both her parents were shot, where she was almost shot. And what she concluded from that was that she should be able to carry a gun because she could’ve actually shot the guy.</p>

      <p class="nameBody">Mike Robbins</p>
      <p class="textBody">How can you conclude from one incident that everyone in the total state of Texas should have a gun?</p>

      <p class="nameBody">Ira Glass</p>
       <p class="textBody">What would you say to her, though? I mean, she said that if she had had a gun at that time-- like what would you want to say to her?</p>

      <p class="nameBody">Mike Robbins</p>
      <p class="textBody">Well, anyone can say could have, should have, would have. Anyone can say that. I mean, this is America. You’re entitled to say whatever it is you want. You have that First Amendment privilege, freedom of speech.</p>

     <p class="nameBody"> Ira Glass</p>
      <p class="textBody">I’m thinking about it. I’m thinking like one of the differences between your experience and hers is that when she and her parents were in this experience where they were shot at, she didn’t have her gun. But you and your partner, you two men, you both had guns.</p>

      <p class="nameBody">Suzanna Hupp</p>
      <p class="textBody">OK, a gun is not a guarantee. It’s not a guarantee. I’m not telling you it’s a guarantee. There are going to be times-- and I tell you, one of the things that I dread is something happening to me, my being, God forbid, murdered at some point, and my being found with the gun somewhere in my possession, because I know people who are anti-gun will use that for all it’s worth. And that’s probably one of my biggest fears. And the fact--</p>

      <p class="nameBody">Ira Glass</p>
      <p class="textBody">Not that you would get murdered, but that you’d get murdered with the gun, and that you’ll be used as propaganda?</p>

    
      <p class="nameBody">Suzanna Hupp</p>
      <p class="textBody">Yes. Yes, and I have to say a thousand times over, it’s not a guarantee. It simply changes the odds.</p>

        <p class="textLast" id="summaryLast">It’s thought-provoking to hear the stories from Mike and Suzanna. They had verysimilar experiences, and yet their perspectives became extremely opposite atthe end. It seems that both teams made great arguemnts. Guns are strongweapons that could have destroyed a man in ten minutes, but also could have protect a whole family from the crime. </p>

        
        <p class='statistics'>ANTI GUN-TEAM AND PRO-GUN TEAM’S ACTIONS ON GUN LAWS</p>
        <p class="textLast">In 1994, The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act was passed. It banned the manufacture, use, possession and import of 19 types of assault weapons, including AR-15, TEC-9, Mac-10, AK-47s and Uzis.</p>

        <p class="textLast">The pro-gun team thinks that violence continues unchecked  despite the ban and people are being denied to the means to protect themselves. In 2004, The Supreme Court striked down the 32-year old D.C. handgun ban as unconstitutional. </p>
